# A conversation on military separation and transition

Two years ago to the day was my EOS (end of service). Like many service members, it was a day that I was looking forward to. And unlike many service members, it was a day that I was well-prepared for.

I’m going to share my process in preparing for this transition so that it may help any service members who are thinking about getting out of the military but do not know where to start.

## Understand the why
The best decision I ever made was joining the Navy. The second best decision I ever made was leaving the Navy. Regardless of the branch that you served in, this is a fairly common shared sentiment amongst the current generation of military veterans–especially us enlisted folks. We all have our reasons for joining, and we all have our reasons for leaving. The first step in separating is understanding the reasons behind your decision. For some, the reasons are [obvious](https://old.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/17apeib/my_personal_reasons_for_getting_out_please_share/).

For me, I was facing burnout because of the time at sea from the constant deployments (what is referred to as a high op tempo) that come along with being deployed in Japan. My physical and mental health was suffering. I could not see myself doing this for another 14 years until I hit the twenty-year mark to qualify for military retirement. What I wanted was a change of pace and a career change.

Service members can easily make a list of reasons why they want to leave the military, but understand the reasons behind why, before making any rash decisions.

Here are some things to consider:
* Do you enjoy what you are doing?
* Can you see yourself doing another enlistment?
* Your family
* Your physical and mental health
* Your finances

The sooner you can understand why you want to leave the military, the sooner you can commit and prepare for that transition.

## Identify your mission
After you identified the why, define your new mission. All service members are taught that the mission comes first, which makes it easy to focus on the work. When you leave the service, a lot of service members lose that sense of purpose because of the lack of a mission.

To help identify your new mission, draw inspiration from your why. For me, my mission was to work towards a career in tech. Tech careers tend to have better compensation and, more often, have better work-life balance, both things that you would not use to describe the Navy.

Leaving the military doesn’t mean the end of your service, find that mission so that you can start planning for that mission.

## Strategic planning
A plan does not come together overnight. Plan in stages. Start with your mission and piece together what it takes to reach that mission objective.

I knew that I wanted to go back to school to complete a degree in computer science. During my free time on deployments, I researched colleges around my hometown for community colleges with transfer articulation agreements to the local state universities, along with auditing their computer science curriculum. This allowed me to figure out how long it would take me to complete my degree, which would determine how much of my GI Bill I would have to use, since I also planned to pursue a masters degree in the future. Other things I had to consider were living costs and employment. Piece by piece, my plan came together. As you gather new information, adjust your plans accordingly.

A good plan is one that is well researched and vetted. Reach out to service members who have made successful transitions, preferably those that have gone down the career path that you are planning to pursue. Learning from their experience will help you formulate a plan that will fit your needs. Seek mentors who have either made that successful transition or work in the career field that you want to be a part of. Mentors can help audit your plan and help make you accountable in sticking to that plan. [Veterati](https://www.veterati.com/) and [American Corporate Partners](https://www.acp-usa.org/) are two non-profit organizations that connect service members to mentors who provide career guidance and networking.

## Execute & Re-evaluate
Now this is the easy part. You have prepared for this. Go and execute the plan.

But what happens when our plans don’t work out? Then why did we make plans in the first place? It is not the plan itself, but the act of planning that lets you choose the best way forward on an unpredictable path. New information will arise. You will have to re-evaluate and make decisions that deviate from the plan. However, having the mission and plan in mind gives you a direction in which to aim and helps you make informed decisions along the way.

## Debrief
I can recall after every ammunition upload and download evolution that my division would debrief about our evolution. Everyone had to contribute a “lesson learned” during that evolution. These “lessons learned” were takeaways on how to improve our evolutions–make it safer and more efficient.

Along your transitions, you will have successes and failures that you can learn from. Keep track of these “lessons learned” because one day someone that you served with will make the same transition that you have made and will want to talk to you about your transition. Your “lessons learned” will be something that you can share to help them with their transition. I encourage you to become mentors one day to help the next group of transitioning service members. Service doesn’t end when you leave the service; it takes a different form.

## Conclusion
Transitions are hard. Some service members have made smooth transitions, while others, like myself, are still working on ours. Never lose track of why you want to make this transition. Be proactive in executing that plan. At the end of the day, separating and transitioning from the military is a journey–the ending of one chapter and the beginning of a new chapter in your life.
