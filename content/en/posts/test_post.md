# A conversation on military separation and transition

Two years ago to the day was my EOS (end of service). Like many service members, it was a day that I was looking forward to. And unlike many service members, it was a day that I was well-prepared for.

I’m going to share my process in preparing for this transition so that it may help any service members who are thinking about getting out of the military but do not know where to start.

## Understand the why
The best decision I ever made was joining the Navy. The second best decision I ever made was leaving the Navy. Regardless of the branch that you served in, this is a fairly common shared sentiment amongst the current generation of military veterans–especially us enlisted folks. We all have our reasons for joining, and we all have our reasons for leaving. The first step in separating is understanding the reasons behind your decision. For some, the reasons are [obvious](https://old.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/17apeib/my_personal_reasons_for_getting_out_please_share/).

For me, I was facing burnout because of the time at sea from the constant deployments (what is referred to as a high op tempo) that come along with being deployed in Japan. My physical and mental health was suffering. I could not see myself doing this for another 14 years until I hit the twenty-year mark to qualify for military retirement. What I wanted was a change of pace and a career change.

Service members can easily make a list of reasons why they want to leave the military, but understand the reasons behind why, before making any rash decisions.

Here are some things to consider:
* Do you enjoy what you are doing?
* Can you see yourself doing another enlistment?
* Your family
* Your physical and mental health
* Your finances

The sooner you can understand why you want to leave the military, the sooner you can commit and prepare for that transition.
